# Linear Algebra Scripts

These scripts take some input and return the answer along with the steps to get there in `amsmath` LaTeX format.
The scripts will try to do things like a normal human would
(e.g. when doing row/column expansion while trying to find the determinant, will choose the row/column with the most zeroes).
